# siterefactor

Refactor or convert markdown-based static sites.

This has been written to evaluate and perform the transition from my
[ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info/)-based site to another site generator, and has
evolved instead as a tool to clean up, refactor, check and maintain my ikiwiki
site.

It is able to parse the subset of ikiwiki's markdown that I use into a logical
representation, and from there it is easy to move pages fixing their links, or
generate output for other engines like [hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
[pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) or [nikola](https://getnikola.com/).
