# blogconvert

Convert markdown-based static sites from one engine to another.

This has been written to evaluate and perform the transition from my
[ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info/)-based blog to another site generator with a
quick preview system.

It currently converts from those features of ikiwiki that I use to
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [nikola](https://getnikola.com/), but it should
be reasonably easy to extend it to read and write other formats.
